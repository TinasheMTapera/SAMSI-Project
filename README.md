# SAMSI-Project: Diffusion Tensor Imaging Analysis

One of my first big data projects at the prestigious SAMSI Undergraduate Statistics Workshop.

Objective: Predicting multiple sclerosis using fractional anisotropy measures along the corpus callosum

In this project, participants at the SAMSI 2016 workshop teamed up to dive into some interesting data and hone their stats and data science chops. Naturally, being a psychology major, I picked the Diffusion Tensor Imaging study, and our team attempted to predict multiple sclerosis diagnosis in participants, given their fractional anisotropy (movement of water) measures along the corpus callosum (the part of the brain that connects the right hemisphere to the left). Needless to say, it was an awesome project, and you can read about it on [my Quora blog](https://dataintensive.quora.com/Predicting-Multiple-Sclerosis-Diagnosis-SAMSI-2016).

This code is by no means perfect; although I was one of the strongest R users in the group, I was just getting into coding practice and learning/figuring out what it means to be algorithmic in ones thinking. So expect there to be many hiccups and rookie tells. I'm considering keeping it up just the way that it is, to show where I came from and be able to compare it to where I am now.
